# Secure Chat
Encryption and decryption chatbot for sending private messages 
Welcome to SecureChat - a demonstration of neural network-based text encryption and decryption. This project uses artificial neural networks with TensorFlow to encrypt your messages securely. Built as part of B.Tech final year project at Technocrats Institute of Technology, Bhopal.

How it works: This system uses a 7-layer auto-associative neural network combined with a randomly generated key matrix to encrypt text messages. The encryption process involves matrix multiplication, neural network transformations, and activation functions to ensure secure communication.
